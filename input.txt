# Introduction to Text-to-Speech

Welcome to the Human-Like TTS Logger for Apple Silicon. This application provides natural-sounding text-to-speech synthesis with comprehensive logging capabilities.

# Features

The application supports multiple TTS engines, including Coqui TTS for local processing and ElevenLabs for cloud-based synthesis. It automatically detects and uses Apple Silicon's Metal Performance Shaders for optimal performance.

# Text Processing

The parser intelligently splits text into segments based on Markdown headers and sentence-ending punctuation. This ensures natural pauses in the generated speech and makes it easier to track progress through longer documents.

# Audio Output

All audio segments are combined into a single output file with optional volume normalization. The system generates detailed logs with timestamps for each segment, making it easy to understand the synthesis process.

# Conclusion

Thank you for using the TTS Logger. We hope you find it useful for your text-to-speech needs!
